# C++, C#, and AngelScript Curly Formatter

Forked from [cs-curly-formatter](https://github.com/Ironcutter24/cs-curly-formatter) to fix VS Code not having same Visual Studio style functionality for curly braces when coding in C++, C#, or AngelScript.

C++ changes in `package.json` were copied from [cpp-curly-formatter](https://github.com/yashelter/cpp-curly-formatter)

Maps `Enter` key to formatting actions:
